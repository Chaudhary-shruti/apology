            Dear Aarohi
        </h1>
<center>

 You and I will meet again again
 <br>
 This hope will keep me going forever
 <br>
 "Some people come into our lives

and leave footprints on our hearts

and we are never ever the same."
<br>
our friendship is the best thing that ever happened to me 
<br>
You helped me find the best verson of myself
<br>
you thought me acceptance, love, sacrifice,carelessness,heart/brain/dustbin
<br>
Even if we cant be together in the end, I am glad that you were a part of my life.
<br>
How am i supposed to say goodbye to someone i can not live without ?
<br>
Promise me. You wont forget our laughs,our jokes,our smiles,our conversations,our plans,our tears,our memories,our experiences,our friendship.
<br>
You better start sending me sweet good morning messages every morning. Otherwise, I will think you forgot me and it would drive me mad.
